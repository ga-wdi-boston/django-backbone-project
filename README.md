# Django-Router.js Project

Use this template to structure your READMEs for talks. Remove text from this
section, or use it to frame the talk you are giving. Good framing answers the
question "Why am I learning this?".

Be sure to include a recent [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) and Markdown linter
configuration ([`.remarkrc`](.remarkrc)). Also, include an appropriate
`.gitignore`; these are usually found in specific technology templates, for
example [js-template](https://www.github.com/ga-wdi-boston/js-template).

## Prerequisites

-   Python
-   django-api
-   router.js

## Objectives

By the end of this, developers should be able to:

-   Create an API for books using Django and Python
-   Create a Client app to display the data using router.js

## Preparation

1.  Fork and Clone this repository.
1.  Use [django-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/django-api) that you did
    yesterday as a template for the api. Base it off of the [library-api](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/library-api)
1.  Use [router.js](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/router.js) as a template
    for your client app.
1.  You can copy the data/books.csv file from the data directory in this repo to
    to use in your api. e.g., from this directory
    `cp data/books.csv <path/to/your/api/data/folder>`
